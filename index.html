    <h1>Toyota Supra</h1>
    <hr>
    <img src="supra.png" alt="pajero">
    <p>
       The fifth-generation GR Supra, the first global Toyota GAZOO Racing model, represents a 50+ year lineage of unique Toyota sports and GT cars. Staying true to its roots, the Supra is powered by an available turbocharged six-cylinder engine along with a rear-wheel drive layout. Instantly recognizable as a Supra,
       the exterior styling accentuates its short wheelbase and sophisticated chassis structure.
       Once you take a seat behind the wheel, driver, car, and road become one. A striking double-bubble roof design reduces drag by shaving the roof center to reduce the projected frontal area without sacrificing occupant headroom. Bold, expressive exterior color choices include Renaissance Red 2.0 and Mikan Blast,
       which emphasize the emotional connection drivers feel with a high-performance sports car.

    <p>
      Fun is what the Honda Civic Type R feasts on. Intended as much for storming race tracks as for road driving, this heavily 
      dramatized version of the standard Civic hatchback is offered exclusively with a raucous 315-hp turbocharged inline-four and six-speed manual transmission.
       On our test track, the CTR threw down mighty levels of grip, sticking to the pavement like a double-yellow line.
